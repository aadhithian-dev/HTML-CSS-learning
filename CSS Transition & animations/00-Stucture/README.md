# Daily Learning Repository

This repository is designed to document my day-to-day learning journey in web development, focusing on front-end technologies, CSS animations, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and full MERN stack projects. Each "day" folder contains:

- **index.html** – Starter HTML page for experiments
- **css/animations.css** – Transitions, keyframes, and layout styles
- **js/scripts.js** – Interactive JavaScript examples
- **screenshots/** – Visual documentation of results (GIFs or images)
- **notes.md** – Concepts learned, challenges, and takeaways
- **README.md** – Summary of the day’s objectives and progress

## Goals
- Track learning progress systematically
- Build reusable code snippets and templates
- Document challenges and solutions for quick reference
- Maintain a professional portfolio of mini-projects and experiments

This repository is intended as both a personal learning journal and a showcase for recruiters or collaborators to see my hands-on development process.
